Each player has two boards: one for their ships and opponent guesses, and one for their guesses for opponents board (Ship board) (Guess board)

Game Setup:
-For each player
    -Set name
    -player adds ships to their ship boards
        For each kind of ship
            User enters coordinates for each ship
                -Check that number of coordinates matches length of ship
                -Check that ship is oriented vertically or horizontally (column number is identical in each coordinate value or row letter is identical in each coordinate value)
                -Check that ship does not occupy any coordinates already occupied by another ship
            If input is valid, save coordinates to ship
            Display ship coordinates on the board

Gameplay:

Player enters a coordinate to target:
    If input coordinate is a coordinate that belongs to one of the opponent's ships:
        -Add coordinate to ships list of destroyed segments
    If opponent's ship's coordinates list matches it's list of destroyed segments:
        -increase player's number of destroyed ships
    If opponent's number of destroyed ships = 5:
        opponent loses
